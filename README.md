# senior-center-app
The senior center application will be a hub for senior citizen residents to obtain relevant and up to date information, update profile information, register for activities, and schedule appointments.

## Description
Residents should be able to see information without logging in and have access to download resources (i.e. latest activity calendar, senior center menus). Residents would also have the option to get access to more features if they create a login account. A login account would permit residents to be able to update certain demographic information (i.e phone #, apt #, medications). An account can allow a user to register for any activities/classes as well as schedule appointments with staff members.

Apart from residents being able to access and login to the site, staff will have an administrator login. This login will allow staff to update resident demographics as well as enter notes regarding any visits/interactions with residents. Staff will be able to create new classes/activities containing class details (i.e dates, registration deadline, instructor info). Once a new class is posted, if a resident cannot register themselves, staff has the ability to register them as well. An attendance sheet will be formulated out of the registration data. The instructor can have access to the attendance sheet on their mobile device once a class begins and he/she can simply check off who is there.
